  <p>ARITHMETIC CALCULATIONS</p>
  <p>A key and important skill is being able to do arithmetics in programming</p>
  <p>There are 4 types - addition, subtraction, multiplication and divisijon</p>
  <p>Addition is adding two numbers, to do so you would write: sum = num1 + num2, where it would add num1 and num2 up.</p>
  <p>The complete code would be:</p>
  <p>num1=input()</p>
  <p>num2=input()</p>
  <p>sum=num1+num2</p>
  <p>print(sum)</p>
  <p>Subtraction is subtracting two numbers, to do so you would write: subtract = num1 - num2, where it would subtract num1 and num2.</p>
  <p>The complete code would be:</p>
  <p>num1=input()</p>
  <p>num2=input()</p>
  <p>subtract = num1 - num2</p>
  <p>print(subtract)</p>
  <p>Multiplication is multplying two numbers, to do so you would write: result = num1 * num2, where it would multiply num1 and num2.</p>
  <p>The complete code would be:</p>
  <p>num1=input()</p>
  <p>num2=input()</p>
  <p>result = num1 * num22</p>
  <p>print(result)</p>
  <p>Division is dividing two numbers, to do so you would write: result = num1 / num2, where it would div ide num1 by num2.</p>
  <p>The complete code would be:</p>
  <p>num1=input()</p>
  <p>num2=input()</p>
  <p>result = num1 / num22</p>
  <p>print(result)</p>
