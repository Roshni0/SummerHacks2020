# TEACHME
The ultimate solution to helping students gain an interest into the world of programming.

This Project is called TeachMe.
*A website to give young children the opportunity to 'taste' different programming languages*

## Inspiration
As a student who was thrown into learning a particular language due to the school curriculum, I never really got the opportunity to learn and explore other languages without having to sign up for a full course. So I developed this product with young students in mind, so that they can go above and beyond and explore different langauges before choosing one to learn fully.

## What it does
This website allows students to explore various languages and teaches them the 4 basic skills: printing and outputting, variables, inputs and arithmetic calculations. Following this, they can work on projects where they have to utilise the skills learnt in order to complete theem, and they can also play games which are made in that particular language.

## How I built it
In order to build this I used HTML,CSS and BootStrap which did most of the front end work. For the back end, I used PHP, MySql and JavaScript. 

## Challenges I ran into
As this was one of the first big projects I have done, there were several challenges along the way. However, one of the main challenges I had was balancing the content with the presentation. Through trial and error, and testing it out on the target age audience, I was able to identify what worked well and what didn't. I made sure that any changes made were done for every page, in order to ensure consistency. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I was assigned a team at the beginning however they all gave up within the first few weeks, so I am glad that I was able to persevere and complete the project on my own. I am also quite proud of the way the project came together, ensuring that the content was presented in an engaging way to help young students. I have tested this with a few students, and all of them have decided to start learning a new language, some have chosen scratch and a few chose python!

## What I learned
Given the large time scale of this project, I have learnt how to manage my time constructively in order to reach my end goal. I also learn how to use APIs in order to help make this project even better!

## What's next for TeachMe
I would like to expand this project further and teach even more programming languages. I would also like to customise the platform to each student, so that it can recommend languages to explore based on what they previously did and what they liked / didn't like
